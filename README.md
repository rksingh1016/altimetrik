Coding Challenge 
Objective:   
   
Write a program that prints out a multiplication table of the first 10 prime numbers.   
The program must run from the command line and print to screen one table.   
Across the top and down the left side should be the 10 primes, and the body of the table should contain the product of multiplying these numbers.   
   
An example of the way the program may run:   
   
<program_name> ­­count 10   
   
An example of the output:   
   
   |  2   3   5   7  11  13  17  19  23  29   
­­­+­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­   
2	|  4   6  10  14  22  26  34  38  46  58   
3	|  6   9  15  21  33  39  51  57  69  87   
 5 | 10  15  25  35  55  65  85  95 115 145   
 7 | 14  21  35  49  77  91 119 133 161 203   
11 | 22  33  55  77 121 143 187 209 253 319   
13 | 26  39  65  91 143 169 221 247 299 377   
17 | 34  51  85 119 187 221 289 323 391 493   
19 | 38  57  95 133 209 247 323 361 437 551   
23 | 46  69 115 161 253 299 391 437 529 667   
29 | 58  87 145 203 319 377 493 551 667 841   
   
Notes:   
   
●	Consider code readability/complexity   
●	Consider cases where we want more than ‘10’ primes   
●	Consider KISS and not over­engineering   
●	Consider re­usability   
●	Write your own implementation for generating prime numbers (DO NOT use a library)  
●	Write tests  
●	Write it in PHP
   
Thanks!   
Solution:
How to run the program:
1. Download/clone the code written in php
2. Run the code locally(php should be installed locally)
3. The output can be seen in text or html(for better tabular format and redability)
